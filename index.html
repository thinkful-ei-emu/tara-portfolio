                <h2>About me</h2>
            </header>

            <p>I am an up-and-coming full-stack web developer currently enrolled in the Engineering Immersion program at Thinkful.</p>
            <p>In my past endeavors, I’ve always found joy in re-engineering systems and processes to better meet the goals of my organization. From redesigning the student committee system at my college, to planning routines and projects for teenagers as a public school teacher, I’ve always looked deeper to find solutions. Coding gives me the opportunity to incorporate that joy into my daily work.</p> 
            <p> Even so, I never really even considered that a possibility for me, an English teacher with a degree in history and economics. It was at a wedding, talking to someone I hadn’t seen in years, when I first heard about coding bootcamps. I had mentioned my desire to leave teaching and try something new and my passion for systems. He recommended coding school, and I made one of the most exciting choices of my lifetime.</p>
            <p>In the evenings, after I’ve had my fill of functions and for loops, I spend my time playing guitar and writing music, playing board games or video games, lifting weights, or daydreaming about my future waste-free full-service grocery store here in Houston, Texas. I always try to find time to travel, taking weekend trips to Texas’ various state parks. And, when I can, going a little farther out to see actual mountains or new cities and countries. If I can’t get out of the city, exploring the many incredible restaurants and breweries of Houston, America’s most diverse city, will do. (Can you tell I totally love h-town?)</p>
            <p>I don’t know where my coding journey will take me. I have some dreams and aspirations—an interactive Dungeons and Dragons character sheet for non-believers, a truly thorough workout planner and tracker. Mainly, I will be happy if I can do good work for a company that makes me proud.</p>
